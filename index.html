                My name is Ryan Johnson, and I work as a product manager for AGCO corporation. My company is a global manufacturer of agricultural equipment like tractors, combines, sprayers and other machines and implements. I work specifically with module technology products fit to our platforms globally. The products I support are in the area of task and field data management, and include on-board vehicle features and off-board web based functionalities designed to complement the customer's machine ownership. I am learning to program so that I can better work with our existing development teams as a product manager, especially those who support the off-board features noted above. In addition to that, I have always had an interest in programming, and the travel downtime during COVID gave me a good opportunity to spend some time learning more about it.             </p>

                From a personal standpoint, I am married to my wife Natalie. We have a big dog whom we call Mr. Coleman. I enjoy outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, and riding motorcycles. I love to cook, but only when its on a big green egg. I am a graduate from the University of Georgia, so another one of my hobbies is "waiting for next year" (football reference).               </p>
