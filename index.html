              My name is Ryan Johnson, and I work as a product manager for AGCO corporation. My company is a global manufacturer of agricultural equipment like tractors, combines, sprayers and other machines and implements. I work specifically with module technology products fit to our platforms globally. The products I oversee are in the area of task and field data management, and include on-board vehicle features and off-board web based functionalities designed to compliment the customer's machine ownership. I am learning to program so I can better work with my development teams, and have a greater understanding and apathy with and for them. In additon to this, I have also always been interested to learn as so much of our day to day lives involve interaction with web based software tools.

            From a personal standpoint, I am married to my wife Natalie. We have one dog, Mr. Coleman. I enjoy outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, and riding motorcycles. I love to cook, but only when its on a big green egg. I'm a UGA grad (Go Dawgs), so well educated professionally and socially but always waiting for next year when it comes to football.
